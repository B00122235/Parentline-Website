		<p class="paragraph">Parentline is a helpline for parents. We offer support, information and guidance on all

					Parentline is a helpline for parents. We offer support, information and guidance on all 
		aspects of parenting in confidence and without judgement. Almost all of Parentline’s 
		work is conducted over the phone.  Less than 1% of contact is face to face.  We deal 
		with parents only and not with children.</p>
	
<h3 class="head3">Procedures</h3>
			<p class="paragraph">Our Child Safeguarding Statement has been developed in line with requirements under 
		the Children First Act 2015, Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and 
		Welfare of Children (2017), and Tusla’s Child Safeguarding: A Guide for Policy,
		Procedure and Practice. In addition to the procedures listed in our risk assessment,
		the following procedures support our intention to safeguard children while they are
		availing of our service:<br><br>
				It should be noted that Parentline does not deal with children as part of our service 
		delivery.  We deal directly with parents only and ask parents not to bring children to 
		our premises.<br><br>
				However, in case there is a breach of this rule the following applies:<br><br>
				All allegations of abuse or misconduct against workers/volunteers must be reported to 
		the CEO (Relevant Person under the Children First Act 2015). This will, in turn, be 
		reported to the Board of Directors of Parentline.<br><br>
				Parentline does not work with children.  All volunteers and staff are trained and made 
		aware of our policies as part of their induction process. References are always checked.<br><br>
				Parentline does not work with children so it is felt that child safeguarding training is not 
		appropriate for everyone. However, the CEO (Relevant Person under the Children First 
		Act 2015) attends appropriate training to keep up to date with current procedures and 
		legislation. This training is typically delivered by Tusla and The Carmichael Centre.<br><br>
				If Parentline becomes aware of a child protection or welfare concern and has identifying 
		information they report it initially to the CEO (Relevant Person) who will then report it to 
		Prevention Partnership & Family Support Manager, Tusla.<br><br>
				As part of the policy, the Relevant Person and Deputy are listed in The Helpline Room, to 
		which all staff and volunteers have access.  Incoming staff or volunteers are informed as 
		part of induction.<br><br>
		The Relevant Person and Deputy Relevant Person are appointed by The Board of Directors. 
Details will be held as part of minutes and reported in the Annual Report<br><br>
		All procedures listed are available upon request.<br><br></p>
	
<h3 class="head3">Implementation</h3>
	<p class="paragraph">We recognise that implementation is an on-going process. Our service is committed to the 
implementation of this Child Safeguarding Statement and the procedures that support our 
intention to keep children safe from harm while availing of our service.<br><br>
		This Child Safeguarding Statement will be reviewed in March 2019 or as soon as practicable 
		after there has been a material change in any matter to which the statement refers.</p>
