	with trained volunteers.<br><br>

	Once trained, we ask volunteers to commit to one three hour shift per week.<br><br>

	In order to match the volunteer needs and to keep up with changing trends and issues that arise for parents 
	Parentline volunteers receive ongoing training. This consists of monthly training sessions where we usually 
	invite an expert speaker who is working in and is familiar with a particular aspect of work. We also have a full 
	day training session each autumn. Topics covered in the training sessions include: drugs, alcohol, suicide, 
	eating disorders, violence…<br><br>
