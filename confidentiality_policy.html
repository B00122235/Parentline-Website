    <h1 class="titles"> CONFIDENTIALITY POLICY </h1> 
	<h3 class="head3">Confidentiality matters</h3> 
		<p class="paragraph">It is Parentline’s intention to ensure that you can discuss your individual situation in 
		complete privacy. We believe that confidentiality provides a safe place for you to look at 
		often difficult situations in your life and discuss feelings, opinions, options, or potential 
		courses of action and consequences. We believe that by you taking the time to discuss 
		your life situation in a safe setting, it can lead to calmer, more informed and rational 
		responses to those situations and an increased sense of well-being and support.</p>
	
<h3 class="head3">Keeping confidence</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">Every effort is taken by Parentline to ensure that your affairs are treated with absolute 
	confidentiality. We want you to feel safe while talking to us so we don’t share anything 
	you say, or any of your personal or contact details, with any other person or 
	organisation. There are a few exceptional circumstances to this which are listed below.</p>
	
<h3 class="head3">Telephone Helpline callers</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">As it is you who initiates contact with Parentline through the Helpline, you remain in 
	control of any information you give to us. We don’t know your contact details and you 
	do not even have to give us your name. (Some callers prefer to make up a first name, 
	others don’t mind giving their real name).<br><br>
			Our service is designed so that we can’t see your phone number when you contact us 
	and when we make outgoing calls it will appear as “Private Number”. Your number nor 
	ours will not appear as caller ID or on itemised phone bills.<br><br>
			The only way we’ll know your contact details is if you give them to us. Often callers will
	leave their name and a contact number on our voicemail for us to call back. When we do 
	make the requested call back, we will do so with absolute discretion. We will not disclose 
	the nature of the call to anyone but the original caller. Contact numbers are not kept on 
	record after a call back has been made.<br><br>
			We do share some information anonymously within Parentline, as we work as a team.<br><br>
			We do record statistical information about calls which assists us in providing a better 
	service and to identify training needs. This information can include the time of call, the 
	gender of parent and child, and a general categorisation of topics discussed. Names and 
	numbers are not recorded.</p>
	
<h3 class="head3">Exceptions to confidentiality</h3>
	<p class="paragraph">There are a few exceptional circumstances by which Parentline may be obliged to 
contact statutory services and break confidentiality. The circumstances are listed below. 
Also please note that Parentline provides their services in line with the Children’s First 
Act.<br><br>
		The only times Parentline will break confidentiality are if: <br>
			<ul class="about1"> <br>
				<li>You request us directly to pass on information about yourself to someone else.</li>
				<li>You inform us about a person or persons who are in danger.</li>
				<li>We receive a court order requiring us to share information.</li>
				<li>We receive a call about acts of terrorism or bomb warnings.</li>
				<li>The safety of our volunteers or service is threatened.</li>
		</ul>
